    OPTICS: Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure
    Equivalent to DBSCAN, finds core sample of high density and expands
    clusters from them. Unlike DBSCAN, keeps cluster hierarchy for a variable
    neighborhood radius. Optimized for usage on large point datasets.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <optics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array, shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The data.

    min_samples : int (default=5)
        The number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered
        as a core point.

    max_eps : float, optional (default=np.inf)
        The maximum distance between two samples for them to be considered
        as in the same neighborhood. Default value of "np.inf" will identify
        clusters across all scales; reducing `max_eps` will result in
        shorter run times.

    metric : string or callable, optional (default='euclidean')
        The distance metric to use for neighborhood lookups. Default is
        "euclidean". Other options include "minkowski", "manhattan",
        "chebyshev", "haversine", "seuclidean", "hamming", "canberra",
        and "braycurtis". The "wminkowski" and "mahalanobis" metrics are
        also valid with an additional argument.

    p : integer, optional (default=2)
        Parameter for the Minkowski metric from
        :class:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances`. When p = 1, this is
        equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance
        (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.

    metric_params : dict, optional (default=None)
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

    maxima_ratio : float, optional (default=.75)
        The maximum ratio we allow of average height of clusters on the
        right and left to the local maxima in question. The higher the
        ratio, the more generous the algorithm is to preserving local
        minima, and the more cuts the resulting tree will have.

    rejection_ratio : float, optional (default=.7)
        Adjusts the fitness of the clustering. When the maxima_ratio is
        exceeded, determine which of the clusters to the left and right to
        reject based on rejection_ratio. Higher values will result in points
        being more readily classified as noise; conversely, lower values will
        result in more points being clustered.

    similarity_threshold : float, optional (default=.4)
        Used to check if nodes can be moved up one level, that is, if the
        new cluster created is too "similar" to its parent, given the
        similarity threshold. Similarity can be determined by 1) the size
        of the new cluster relative to the size of the parent node or
        2) the average of the reachability values of the new cluster
        relative to the average of the reachability values of the parent
        node. A lower value for the similarity threshold means less levels
        in the tree.

    significant_min : float, optional (default=.003)
        Sets a lower threshold on how small a significant maxima can be.

    min_cluster_size : int > 1 or float between 0 and 1 (default=0.005)
        Minimum number of samples in an OPTICS cluster, expressed as an
        absolute number or a fraction of the number of samples (rounded
        to be at least 2).

    min_maxima_ratio : float, optional (default=.001)
        Used to determine neighborhood size for minimum cluster membership.
        Each local maxima should be a largest value in a neighborhood
        of the `size min_maxima_ratio * len(X)` from left and right.

    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, optional
        Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:

        - 'ball_tree' will use :class:`BallTree` (default)
        - 'kd_tree' will use :class:`KDTree`
        - 'brute' will use a brute-force search.
        - 'auto' will attempt to decide the most appropriate algorithm
          based on the values passed to :meth:`fit` method.

        Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting of
        this parameter, using brute force.

    leaf_size : int, optional (default=30)
        Leaf size passed to :class:`BallTree` or :class:`KDTree`. This can
        affect the speed of the construction and query, as well as the memory
        required to store the tree. The optimal value depends on the
        nature of the problem.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    Returns
    -------
    core_sample_indices_ : array, shape (n_core_samples,)
        The indices of the core samples.

    labels_ : array, shape (n_samples,)
        The estimated labels.

        The maximum ratio we allow of average height of clusters on the

        ratio, the more generous the algorithm is to preserving local
        minima, and the more cuts the resulting tree will have.

    rejection_ratio : float, optional
        Adjusts the fitness of the clustering. When the maxima_ratio is
        exceeded, determine which of the clusters to the left and right to
        reject based on rejection_ratio. Higher values will result in points
        being more readily classified as noise; conversely, lower values will
        result in more points being clustered.

    similarity_threshold : float, optional
        Used to check if nodes can be moved up one level, that is, if the
        new cluster created is too "similar" to its parent, given the
        similarity threshold. Similarity can be determined by 1) the size
        of the new cluster relative to the size of the parent node or
        2) the average of the reachability values of the new cluster
        relative to the average of the reachability values of the parent
        node. A lower value for the similarity threshold means less levels
        in the tree.

    significant_min : float, optional
        Sets a lower threshold on how small a significant maxima can be.

    min_cluster_size : int > 1 or float between 0 and 1
        Minimum number of samples in an OPTICS cluster, expressed as an
        absolute number or a fraction of the number of samples (rounded

    min_maxima_ratio : float, optional

    -------
    core_sample_indices_ : array, shape (n_core_samples,)
        The indices of the core samples.

    labels_ : array, shape (n_samples,)

    reachability_plot : array, shape (n_samples)
        The reachability plot, i.e. reachability ordered according to

    start : integer

    ixi: float, between 0 and 1
        The inverse xi, i.e. `1 - xi`

    min_samples : integer
       The same as the min_samples given to OPTICS. Up and down steep
       regions can't have more then `min_samples` consecutive non-steep
       points.

        Total number of samples.

    Returns
    -------
    index : integer
        The current index iterating over all the samples.

    end : integer
